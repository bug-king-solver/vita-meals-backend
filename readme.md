## Technical Test Project for Vita Meals

The candidate is kindly requested to complete the following project by the deadline provided in the email communication.

### Delivery Method

The candidate is asked to create a private repository on GitHub and invite the following contacts: valerio.castellana@vitameals.com and andrea.lippolis@vitameals.com.

It will then be necessary to indicate which branch will contain the code to be evaluated.

### Context

PincoPallo Ltd. is a company that has been operating in the food sector for years. Following an increase in sales, they have decided to release a new application that allows their customers to browse their product catalog and place direct orders without going through physical stores.

The product categories should be freely accessible, returning the name and price for each product.

Each user can place an order by selecting desired products and quantities.

During order creation, the user should be prompted to log in via username and password if not already authenticated.

After placing an order, the system should send an email to the customer service to inform them of the received order, and an email to the user to confirm the order with an attached summary file.

### Notes

The frontend part is not necessary; however, the backend should be developed using REST APIs.

Documentation of the code using DocBlock is required.

### Optional

- Not mandatory but appreciated:
- API management using tokens.
- Creation of an ER model.
- Testing.
- Docker environment for running the application.
